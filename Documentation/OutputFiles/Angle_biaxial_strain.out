In this example, we find a commensurate angle for black phosphorene bilayer with a rectangular lattice.

1.From the directory with the input file get_ang.inp, in the terminal, run the following command:
  python path_to_Get_Ang/SRC/get_ang.py

2.An output file will be written corresponding to each angle as "Angle_%angle%"

An explained sample output file is given below.

#Twist angle in deg
Twist angle:27.800000

#Co-efficients of vector 1 and vector 2 in top layer

Superlattice (vector 1(n1,n2),vector2(n1',n2')):
-4.000000 3.000000
-3.000000 -1.000000

#Co-efficients of vector 1 and vector 2 in bottom layer  

Superlattice_m (vector 1(n1,n2),vector2(n1',n2')):
-3.000000 4.000000
-4.000000 1.000000

#Number of atoms in the superlattice
Total number of atoms: 78

#self-explanatory
Angle between super lattice vectors: 90.000000


#Mismatch between top and bottom layer vectors in Angstroms
Mismatch (vector1,vector2): 0.000842 0.000842

#Percentage by which each lattice parameter is strained

Strain Percent (vector 1,vector2): -0.000000 -0.000000


#Strained lattice parameters for a better fit

New lattice parameter layer 1: 3.164000 3.164000 25.000000
New lattice parameter layer 2: 3.164000 3.164000 25.000000


#Mismatch between top and bottom layer vectors in Angstroms with strained lattice parameters

Mismatch with new lattice parmaters (vector1,vector2): 0.000842 0.000842



3.Select the angle,corresponding superlattice co-efficientsas well as the  new lattice parameters and feed them to Twister 1.2. Refer to Twister 1.2 README for format of input and  more information.

Note:

1) The program is coded to give the superlattices with minimum area with an error of 1% allowed. The user is suggested to use the vectors with minimum mismatch.

2) In case of lack of results, possible errors will be printed in the terminal.
