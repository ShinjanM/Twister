This directory contains examples for relaxing the moir\'e superlattices
using forcefields as implemented in the LAMMPS package.

NOTE: Please go through the README in the TMD relaxations carefully -- it 
requires an additional step during the LAMMPS compilation to get the 
Stillinger-Weber intralayer forcefields to work in the desired manner.

Tips on installing LAMMPS with the required packages are provided in 
LAMMPS_INSTALL
