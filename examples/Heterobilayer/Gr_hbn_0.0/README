In this example, we compare the result for Gr-hBN bilayer in a range 
of twist-angles around 0 degree twist-angle with results from Coincidence 
Lattices of 2D Crystals: Heterostructure Predictions and Applications, Koda et al, 2016.  

Running this example:

To find the commensurate twist-angles and new lattice parameters:
mpirun -n 50 python $pathtoTwisterSRC/get_angle.py

See Documentation/ for more details of the input and output.

The commensurate twist-angle, superlattice vectors (n1, n2; n1', n2')
and new lattice parameters are used in twist.inp along with the basis 
atom positions in files basis_pos_crys and basis_pos_crys_layer2. 

To obtain the atom positions in the superlattice:
python $pathtoTwisterSRC/twister.py
