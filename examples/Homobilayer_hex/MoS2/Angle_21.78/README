The input file, twist.inp, here is constructed using i = 1
entry of hex.table (../../hex.table).

basis_pos_crys file contains the basis of one Mo atom and 
two S atoms.

To run this example, run from command line:

python path_to_Twister/SRC/twister.py

The superlattice vectors in units of celldm1_l,
and atom positions (in Angstroms) constituting 
the superlattice are provided in superlattice.dat

A reference Quantum Espresso input file, in.QE, for 
this superlattice is also provided.
