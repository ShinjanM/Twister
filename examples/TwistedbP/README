In this example, we find commensurate twist-angle for twisted bilayer phosphorene.

From the directory with the input file get_ang.inp, 
in the terminal, run the following command:
python path_to_Get_Ang/SRC/get_ang.py

The documentation of the input can be found in the Documentation/ folder.

An output file will be written corresponding to each angle as 
"Angle_%angle%". The documentation of the output can be found 
in the Documentation/ folder.

To find commensurate twist-angles, run get_ang.inp for a range of twist-angles.  

1. If output files are generated,they will have commensurate twist-angle 
   with no mismatch. 

2. Find the twist-angle with suitable area/atoms by checking 
   the solutions in the output files. 

Once you find the commensurate twist-angle, generate twist.inp with 
the new lattice vectors and twist-angle and run twister.py to obtain 
the atom positions in the superlattice. This step is performed in a 
new folder Ang_%angle%.
