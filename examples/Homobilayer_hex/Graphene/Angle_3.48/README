The input file, twist.inp, is constructed using i = 9
entry of hex.table (../../hex.table). 
Angle: 0.0607550175432 radians
(m,n): (9,10)
(p,q): (-10,19)

basis_pos_crys file contains the basis of two C atoms.

To run this example, run from command line:

python path_to_Twister/src/twister.py

The superlattice vectors in units of celldm1,
and atom positions (in Angstroms) constituting 
the superlattice are provided in superlattice.dat


A reference Quantum Espresso input file, in.QE, for 
this superlattice is also provided. 

Plot_lattice is set as False to avoid plotting the structure,
and reduce the computation time.
