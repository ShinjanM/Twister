In this example, we find a commensurate angle for black phosphorene bilayer with a rectangular lattice.

1.From the directory with the input file get_ang.inp, in the terminal, run the following command:
  python path_to_Get_Ang/SRC/get_ang.py

2.An output file will be written corresponding to each angle as "Angle_%angle%"

An explained sample output file is given below.

#Twist angle in deg

3.Select the angle,corresponding superlattice co-efficients as well as the  new lattice parameters and feed them to Twister 1.2. Refer to Twister 1.2 README for format of input and  more information.

Note:

1) The program is coded to give the superlattices with minimum area with an error of 1% allowed.

2) In case of lack of results, possible errors are printed in the terminal.
