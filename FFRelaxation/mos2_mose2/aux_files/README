=> Set of auxillary files that you need to simplify
the moire lattice generation and performing 
the relaxation using lammps.
=> This can be used by homo-bilayers with triangular
lattice.

--------------------------------------------------------
basis_pos_crys: 	basis of one Mo and two S atoms
			(layer 1 - Mos2)
basis_pos_crys_l2: 	basis of one Mo and two Se atoms
			(layer 2 - MoSe2)

toqe.py:		Generates a reference input file 
                        for quantum espresso after reading
                        the superlattice.dat file produced
                        by twister

lammps_triclinic.py:	Generates a lammps.dat file 
                        formatted the way LAMMPS package 
                        can use

tolammps.py:		Generates a reference input file
                        for LAMMPS, with the atomic 
                        positions taken from lammps.dat 

Mass_FF:		Provide the masses and 
			forcefield(FF) you wish to include

Note that, for relaxation with lammps, you need two things:
1) pre-built lammps executable, 2) force-fields. 
Go through this example of mos2 to understand how to build 
lammps executable and set-up these forcef-fields. 
It is upto the user to choose an accurate force-field before performing the relaxation with lammps. 

run_lammps.py:		Run lammps using a python wrapper.
extract_pos.py:		After lammps minimization, this
			file extracts the lattice vectors,
			atomic positions from the output

homo.sh:		The script that needs to be run
                        see examples as to how to modify
The examples for generating twist angles near 0 degree 
and performing the relaxation are given in the folder 
near_0. Similarly for near 60 degrees calculations, 
please have a look at the near_60 folder. Both without 
and with the python wrapper examples are provided.  
---------------------------------------------------------


Note: 

System dependent input files for the auxillary files are:
1) Mass_FF 
2) basis_pos_crys and basis_pos_l2
If you wish to perform similar calculations for a different homobilayer, for instance WS2 or WSe2 or graphene etc, you only need to modify the above two files along with the force-field files in ff folder.
