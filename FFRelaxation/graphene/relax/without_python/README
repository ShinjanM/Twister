=> Construction of moire superlattice for twisted bilayer
graphene with atomic relaxation.

---------------------------------------------------
The force-field used in this directory for twisted bilayer
of graphene will be a combination of REBO and registry
dependent Kolmogorov-Crespi Potential. The corresponding
forcefield files are available in the aux_files/ff
directory, i) CH.rebo ii) CC.KC.  They are used to describe
intra and interlayer interaction of graphene layers,
respectively.

The user must install LAMMPS as a standard build
explained in /path-to-graphene/LAMMPS_INSTALL 

In the script (run.sh), init=1, end=6 were set
to produce twist angles kept in the reference directory.
Please, also note that while performing relaxation we are 
using standard lammps build without python wrapper. 
The python wrapper example can be found in with_python 
directory 

To reproduce this example, run from command line:

bash run.sh


The superlattice vectors in units of celldm1,
and atom positions (in Angstroms) constituting
the superlattice are provided in superlattice.dat.

A reference Quantum Espresso input file, qe.in, for
this superlattice is also provided.

Simulataneously, a reference LAMMPS input file, lammps.in
along with formatted data file, lammps.dat are also created.
The data file and the input provided are used to perform
atomic relaxation.  Please see the log.lammps file in the
corresponding directory to find out the output.


lammps.dat_min: file produced by lammps after minimization.
