In this example, we compare hBN-MoSe2 bilayer solutions in a range around 
19.1 degree twist-angle with results from Coincidence Lattices of 
2D Crystals: Heterostructure Predictions and Applications, Koda et al, 2016.  

The method described in Section 2.1 of the paper is used to find 
commensurate twist-angles.


To find the commensurate twist-angles and new lattice parameters:
mpirun -n 1 python $pathtoTwisterSRC/get_angle.py

The twist-angle of 19.11 degrees has the smallest mismatch.
The mismatch can be checked by: grep Mismatch Angle_*

The commensurate twist-angle and new lattice parameters
are used in twist.inp along with the basis atom positions in
files basis_pos_crys and basis_pos_crys_layer2.

To obtain the atom positions in the superlattice:
python $pathtoTwisterSRC/twister.py


To visualize the generated superlattice:
python $pathtoTwisterSRC/tovasp.py

This generates POSCAR.vasp which can be directly visualized 
using VESTA (http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/)
