We provide the Kolmogorov-Crespi interlayer potential files in 
the Potentials/ folder. These are in a format suitable to be used 
with the LAMMPS package (https://lammps.sandia.gov/). If you use 
these potentials please cite the following paper:


The Examples/ folder provides the LAMMPS input file for 
the KC potential to be used in conjunction with the 
Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential. The SW potentials 
need to be downloaded from http://jiangjinwu.org/sw 
and put in the appropriate folder. The user may 
download 'supplement.zip' from the link and look 
in the folder: supplement/sw_lammps/

MoS2 example needs h-mos2.sw
WS2 example needs h-ws2.sw
MoSe2 example needs h-mose2.sw
WSe2 example needs h-wse2.sw

The lammps.in in each Example sets up the intralayer SW and interlayer 
KC/z interaction and relaxes the AB stacked TMD. The SW potentials 
downloaded from the above link use a rectangular unit cell of 12 atoms
for monolayer.

Instructions to compile LAMMPS with SW, KC support:
In the LAMMPS package src/ directory run the following in the same
order:
make serial
make yes-USER-MISC
make yes-MOLECULE
make yes-MANYBODY
make serial
