=> Construction of moire superlattice for twisted bilayer 
graphene without atomic relaxation.

--------------------------------------------------- 
In the homo.sh script, init=1, end=6 were set
to produce twist angles kept in the reference directory. 
Since no relaxation will be performed, don't worry about 
forcefield, lammps_path and style. 

basis_pos_crys file contains the basis of two c atoms.

To reproduce this example, run from command line:

bash homo.sh


The superlattice vectors in units of celldm1,
and atom positions (in Angstroms) constituting 
the superlattice are provided in superlattice.dat.

A reference Quantum Espresso input file, qe.in, for 
this superlattice is also provided.

Simulataneously, a reference LAMMPS input file, lammps.in along
with formatted data file, lammps.dat are also created. The data
file and the input provided can de directly used with 
LAMMPS.
