Generic installation the current/latest version of lammps

--------------------------------------------------------
=> LAMMPS without python wrapper (standard build with make)

Step 1: Download the most-recent lammps tar file and untar it.
Go to src folder and 
type the following to see your options:

make 


Step 2: In the src directory, install prticular packages 
by typing : 

make yes-packagename 

For our purpose we need atleast the following packages. Install 
them by typing: 

make yes-MANYBODY
make yes-USER-MISC
 
Once, you have installed these, cross-check by typing: 

make ps 

Step 3: Now build (serial) by typing: 

make serial


After this you should have the lammps exceutable in the src directory: 
lmp_serial

You need to give the path of this executable while 
performing relaxation when not using lammps python 
wrapper.

--------------------------------------------------------------
=> Lammps with python wrapper

Step 1P: Carry out Steps 1-2 for lammps installation without 
python wrapper, as mentioned.  And add the following by typing:

make yes-PYTHON 

Step 2P: Build lammps as shared object. This is acheieved by typing: 

make mode=shlib serial

Step 3P: In your .cshrc add the lammps libpath:
vi ~/.cshrc
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:path-to-lammps-directory/src/

Now, type: 

source ~/.cshrc 

Or, similarly for ~/.bashrc Add the following in your ~/.bashrc :

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path-to-lammps-directory/src

Now, type:

source ~/.bashrc

# Step 4P:  install python wrapper by typing in the src directory:

make install-python 

# Step 4P_1: Cross-checking if installation is correct 
create a python input file named, check.py which has the following:
from lammps import lammps
lmp = lammps()

If after running the check.py (python check.py), you don't get 
any errors, the installation went fine. Or optionally, you can paste the above commands on your python interpreter.
