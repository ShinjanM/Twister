In this example, we find commensurate twist-angles for twisted bilayer phosphorene.

From the directory with the input file get_ang.inp, 
in the terminal, run the following command:
python path_to_Get_Ang/SRC/get_ang.py

The documentation of the input can be found in the Documentation/ folder.

To find commensurate twist-angles, run get_ang.inp for a range of twist-angles.  

1. If output files are generated,they will have commensurate twist-angle 
   with no mismatch. 

2. A twist.inp file will be generated with 
the new lattice vectors and twist-angle with minimum deformation and smallest superllatice area. Run twister.py to obtain 
the atom positions in the superlattice.  

An output file will be written corresponding to each angle as "Angle_%angle%" in the solutions/ folder. 
The documentation of the output can be found in the Documentation/ folder.


To visualize the generated structure, we provide a utility, tovasp.py, which reads 
twist.inp and superlattice.dat to generate POSCAR.vasp. This can be visualised 
directly in VESTA (http://jp-minerals.org/vesta)
