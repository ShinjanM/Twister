=> Construction of moire superlattice for twisted bilayer
mos2 near 60 degrees with atomic relaxation and with standard
lammps build (i.e. without python wrapper).

---------------------------------------------------
The force-field used in this directory for twisted bilayer 
of mos2 will be a combination of Stillinger-Weber 
(parametrized as in: http://jiangjinwu.org/sw, within
sw_mx2.zip file) and registry dependent Kolmogorov-Crespi
Potential (Naik et al., as in J. Phys. Chem. C 2019, 123,
15, 9770-9778). The corresponding forcefield files are
available in the current directory, i) mos2.sw ii) MoS.KC.
They are used to describe intra and interlayer interaction
of mos2 layers, respectively.


It is extremely important, that the user modifies
pair_sw.cpp as suggested in:
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10338-018-0049-z#appendices
After this, please rebuild the lammps executable.
For convenience, the modified pair_sw.cpp is provided here.

[If you have not yet built lammps already, please see 
/path-to-examples-of-mos2/LAMMPS_INSTALL]

After this replace the original pair_sw.cpp by the one
provided here (or, you can modify the pair_sw.cpp yourself)
and type:

make serial


Without this step, if you simply run the script, homo.sh
the intralayer interaction will be completely wrong. 


In the script (homo.sh), init=1, end=6 were set
to produce twist angles kept in the reference directory.
Please, also note that while performing relaxation we are 
using standard lammps build without python wrapper. 
The python wrapper example can be found in with_python 
directory 

basis_pos_crys file contains the basis of one Mo atom and
two S atoms.


To reproduce this example, please edit the following variables in
homo.sh:
hextable='' # Can be the current directory.
twister_path='' # Path to Twister SRC folder
aux_files='' # Path to Twister/KC_relaxation/mos2/aux_files/
basis_file='' # Path to Twister/KC_relaxation/mos2/aux_files/basis_60
forcefield='' # Path to Twister/KC_relaxation/mos2/aux_files/ff
lammps_path='' #  lammps executable path

Run from command line:

bash homo.sh


The superlattice vectors in units of celldm1,
and atom positions (in Angstroms) constituting
the superlattice are provided in superlattice.dat.

A reference Quantum Espresso input file, qe.in, for
this superlattice is also provided.

Simulataneously, a reference LAMMPS input file, lammps.in
along with formatted data file, lammps.dat are also created.
The data file and the input provided are used to perform
atomic relaxation.  Please see the log.lammps file in the
corresponding directory to find out the output.


lammps.dat_min: file produced by lammps after minimization.
relaxed_data:   extracted atomic positons and lattice vectors
                from lammps.dat_min
