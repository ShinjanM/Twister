=> Construction of moire superlattice for twisted bilayer
mos2 near 60 degrees with atomic relaxation and with python 
wrapper.

---------------------------------------------------
The force-field used in this directory for twisted bilayer 
of mos2 will be a combination of Stillinger-Weber 
(parametrized as in: http://jiangjinwu.org/sw, within
sw_mx2.zip file) and registry dependent Kolmogorov-Crespi
Potential (Naik et al., as in J. Phys. Chem. C 2019, 123,
15, 9770-9778). The corresponding forcefield files are
available in the current directory, i) mos2.sw ii) MoS.KC.
They are used to describe intra and interlayer interaction
of mos2 layers, respectively.


It is extremely important, that the user modifies
pair_sw.cpp as suggested in:
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10338-018-0049-z#appendices
After this, please rebuild the lammps executable.
For convenience, the modified pair_sw.cpp is provided here.

[If you have not yet built lammps already, please see 
/path-to-examples-of-mos2/LAMMPS_INSTALL. Following the 
steps, please build lammps with python wrapper first.]

After this in the src directory replace the pair_sw.cpp by 
the downloaded one, which is provided here. Replace the 
original pair_sw.cpp by the one provided here and type:

make mode=shlib serial
make install-python

Without this step, if you simply run the script, homo.sh
the intralayer interaction will be completely wrong. 


In the script (homo.sh), init=1, end=6 were set
to produce twist angles kept in the reference directory.
Please, also note that while performing relaxation we are 
using standard lammps build without python wrapper. 
The python wrapper example can be found in with_python 
directory 

basis_pos_crys file contains the basis of one Mo atom and
two S atoms.

To reproduce this example, run from command line:

bash homo.sh


The superlattice vectors in units of celldm1,
and atom positions (in Angstroms) constituting
the superlattice are provided in superlattice.dat.

A reference Quantum Espresso input file, qe.in, for
this superlattice is also provided.

Simulataneously, a reference LAMMPS input file, lammps.in along
with formatted data file, lammps.dat are also created. The data
file and the input provided are used to perform atomic relaxation.
Please see the log.lammps file in the corresponding directory 
to find out the output.


lammps.dat_min: file produced by lammps after minimization.
relaxed_data:   extracted atomic positons and lattice vectors
                from lammps.dat_min
