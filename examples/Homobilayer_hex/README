HEXAGONAL LATTICES:
(With the same lattice parameter, eg. twisted bilayer graphene, 
twisted bilayer MoS2)

For twist angles close to 0 degrees:

Start with AA stacking of the two layers. The commensurate 
angles are given by:

theta_i = arccos((3*i**2 + 3*i + 0.5)/(3*i**2 + 3*i + 1)) - (1)
(from J. M. B. Lopes dos Santos, N. M. R. Peres, and A. H. Castro Neto, 
Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 256802 (2007))

for i = 0,1,2,3...

Larger the i, the closer you get to 0 degrees. 

Please look at README_steps for steps on how to run 
the code.

For twist angles close to 60 degrees: 

Start with Bernal/AB stacking of the two layers. Note that the Bernal 
stacking is a 60 degree twist of the AA stacking. Thus, 
starting with a 60 degree stacking, we twist by the same angle  
(1) as above to generate commensurate angles close to 60.

Larger the i, the closer you get to 60 degrees.
