The input file, twist.inp, is constructed using i = 30
entry of hex.table (../../hex.table). This angle is the 
first 'magic' angle in tBLG.

Angle: 0.0189289518072 radians
(m,n): (30, 31)
(p,q): (-31, 61)

basis_pos_crys file contains the basis of two C atoms.

To run this example, run from command line:

python path_to_Twister_1.0/src/twister.py

The superlattice vectors in units of celldm1,
and atom positions (in Angstroms) constituting 
the superlattice are provided in superlattice.dat


A reference Quantum Espresso input file, in.QE, for 
this superlattice is also provided. 

Plot_lattice is set as False to avoid plotting the structure,
and reduce the computation time. 
Note that the computation will 
take a while. You can see the superlattice.dat file 
being updated.
